# PokeScreenshot

This Android app reads the screenshots that you take from your pokémons in
[Pokémon GO][pokemon go] and it said you the pokémon IVs.


## How it works

This app only reads the screenshots that you take with your phone so you are not
breaking the [Pokémon Go's policy][pokemon go policy] using it.

## Download

The app is still in beta. You can download it from the [Google Play][google play].

We don't have access to all the devices and we don't catch yet all the pokémon.
So, please report any problem you spot. The app usually detect this errors and
it asks you if you want to report it. Please, report this errors to improve the
app.
